Hybrid CMOS-MTJ logic circuit SPICE Netlists

These are Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) netlists of some hybrid Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and Magnetic tuneling junciton (MTJ) circuits which I worked on during my research internship at the Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi.

The MTJ models are not included as I used the models provided to me by IIT-BHU which I cannot share here, apologies for any inconvinience caused.
